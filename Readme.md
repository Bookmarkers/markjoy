#### Basics: Research & User testing
- [X] Create a Readme file to keep track of tasks and goals.
- [X] Download / use similar apps to see what we like and don't
- [X] Schema design v.1
- [X] Project tasks
- [X] User stories
- [ ] Come up with 5-ish main categories (defaults) + name for the unsorted category
- [ ] Review and implement schema design v1.1
- [ ] Finalize Wireframe v1.0
- [ ] Finalize Tech stack by EOD Thursday July 2nd
- [ ] Read up on PWA's
- [ ] Read up on ways to import current Chrome browser bookmarks into our extension
- [ ] Read up on ways to redirect from blocked sites
- [ ] Research Vue and Firestore

#### Importing existing Chrome browser bookmarks
- [ ] Export it as an HTML file - how to do it in code?
    - [ ] Do we convert folders into categories?
- [ ] Importing and making sense of the bookmarks - how to do it in code?

#### Redirecting or layering over blocked sites
- [ ] When the user goes to a blocked site, no matter the length of the url, they are redirected to our SPA
    - [ ] AND/OR (stretch goal?) user goes to a blocked site and there is a layer and/or header on that page with the goalie bookmark suggestions

### UX/UI
- [ ] Lightweight favicon
- [ ] Sorting bookmarks with buttons and/or dropdown menu?
- [ ] On-the-page alert of bookmark added / bookmark removed
- [ ] Rounded buttons for suggestions of which goal/category to put this newly added bookmark in.


### Stretch goals


#### Testing

- [ ] Everyone writes their own ~3 tests for each file after the project has started to take shape / stabilize.
