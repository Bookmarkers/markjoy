bookmarq is a bookmark management and productivity tool that allows the user to assign bookmarks to relevant goals and categories. The user can also define "blocked" websites; upon visiting one of the blocked URLs, the user will be redirected to the user home page that suggests readings based on their saved links.

Developed with Node.js, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, React, Redux, and Semantic UI.

#### Basics: Research & User testing

* [ ] Read up on ways to import current Chrome browser bookmarks into our extension
* [ ] Read up on ways to redirect from blocked sites

#### Importing existing Chrome browser bookmarks

* [ ] Export it as an HTML file - how to do it in code?
  * [ ] Stretch goal: intelligently sort all folder content into one category.
* [ ] Importing and making sense of the bookmarks - how to do it in code?

#### Redirecting or layering over blocked sites

* [ ] When the user goes to a blocked site, no matter the length of the url, they are redirected to our SPA
  * [ ] AND/OR (stretch goal?) user goes to a blocked site and there is a layer and/or header on that page with the goalie bookmark suggestions

### UX/UI

* [ ] Sorting bookmarks with buttons and/or dropdown menu?
* [ ] On-the-page alert of bookmark added / bookmark removed
* [ ] Rounded buttons for suggestions of which goal/category to put this newly added bookmark in.

### Stretch goals

#### Testing

* [ ] Everyone writes their own ~3 tests for each file after the project has started to take shape / stabilize.
