#### Basics: Research & User testing
- [X] Create a Readme file to keep track of tasks and goals.
- [ ] Download / use similar apps to see what we like and don't
- [ ] Read up on ways to import current Chrome browser bookmarks into our extension
- [ ] Read up on ways to redirect from blocked sites
- [ ] Research Vue and Firestore
- [ ] Schema design
- [ ] Project tasks
- [ ] User stories

#### Importing existing Chrome browser bookmarks
- [ ] Export it as an HTML file - how to do it in code?
    - [ ] Do we intelligently convert folders into categories?
- [ ] Importing and making sense of the bookmarks - how to do it in code?

#### Redirecting or layering over blocked sites
- [ ] When the user goes to a blocked site, no matter the length of the url, they are redirected to a specific page
- [ ] OR user goes to a blocked site and there is a layer and/or header on that page with bookmark suggestions

### UX/UI
- [ ] Lightweight favicon
- [ ] Drag & Drop functionality for sorting bookmarks
